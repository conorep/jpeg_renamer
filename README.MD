## PURPOSE:
Create a faster, easier means of renaming many pictures of the same item at once.


### REQUIREMENTS:
* This program is dependent on Java version 22.
* The batch file (run.bat) is only helpful in a Windows environment.
* Pictures that you want to rename must be in the same folder as run.bat and PortalPicNames.jar.
* For now, this program is only suited to rename .jpg files.
* Place run.bat and a compiled .jar file in a folder. The .jpg files you drop in that folder will all be targeted for 
quick, easy renaming.


### A LIGHT WARNING:
ONLY drop .jpg files in this folder if you want them ALL renamed with the same part number/serial number! You can 
rename files as many times as you want of course, but it defeats the productivity increase.


### USAGE:
1.	Drop all the incoming or outgoing pictures of the unit that you are using to name the files.
2.	Double-click run.bat to open command prompt.
3.	Follow the command prompt instructions to rename several files at once with an automatic iteration of the picture 
number.

* 020-0047-02_SN0047_out_2.jpg
