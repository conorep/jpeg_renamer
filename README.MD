## PURPOSE:
Create a faster, easier means of renaming and resizing many pictures of the same item at once.


### REQUIREMENTS:
* This program is dependent on Java version 22.
* The batch file (run.bat) is only helpful in a Windows environment.
* Place run.bat and a compiled .jar file in a folder.
* The .jpg files you want to rename/resize must be in the same folder as run.bat and the .jar file.
* For now, this program only works with .jpg files.


### A LIGHT WARNING:
ONLY drop .jpg files in this folder if you want them ALL renamed with the same part number/serial number(s)! You can 
rename files as many times as you want of course, but it defeats the productivity increase.


### USAGE:
1.	Drop all incoming or outgoing photos of the unit(s) you want renamed/resized.
2.	Double-click run.bat to open command prompt.
3.	Follow the command prompt instructions to rename/resize several files at once.
4.  Renamed pictures get an iterative number appended to the file name.


### EXAMPLE FILE NAME OUTPUT:
* 020-0047-02_SN0047_out_1.jpg
* 020-0047-02_SN0047_out_2.jpg
* 020-0047-02_SN0047_out_3.jpg
